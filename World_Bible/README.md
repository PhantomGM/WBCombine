# World_Bible (Combined Obsidian Vault)

This vault merges the contents of the three original world-bible directories into a single home. All folders, templates, dashboards, and configuration files are now available together under `World_Bible/`.

## Folder Overview
- `00_Overview` through `14_Systems_and_Mechanics` gather the full template set from the comprehensive vault.
- `01_Foundation_Concept` through `11_Additional_Resources_References` retain the streamlined reference structure.
- `4 - Details` contains the focused resources that previously lived in the separate "Details" vault.
- `Dashboards`, `Templates`, and supporting assets remain ready for quick duplication.

You can safely add new notes or subfolders; everything is organized for use with Obsidian and Dataview.

## Recommended Obsidian Plugins
- Dataview
- Templater
- Excalidraw (relationship maps)
- Map View / Leaflet (optional)
- Tag Wrangler
- Breadcrumbs

## Tag Conventions
Use topical tags to keep cross-links rich and searchable: `#npc`, `#faction`, `#region`, `#settlement`, `#quest`, `#encounter`, `#magicitem`, `#lore`, `#dna`.

## Cross-link Examples
- `[[06_Factions/Wanderers_Guild/Overview]]`
- `[[07_NPCs/Silas_Croft/Profile]]`
- `[[04_Settlements/Eastgate/Overview]]`
- `[[4 - Details/Resources - Materials/Resources]]`

Enjoy worldbuilding!
