# World Bible (Obsidian Vault)

Welcome! This vault ships with a full folder structure, templates, and example notes wired for cross-linking and Dataview. It now consolidates every world-bible resource that previously lived in separate folders (`World_Bible1`, `world_bible`, and `World_Bible_`).

## Directory Overview
- `00_Overview` – vault guidelines, style references, and world summary sheets.
- `01_Cosmology` – creation myths, pantheons, metaphysical laws, and planar structure.
- `01_Foundation_Concept` – high-level DNA for the setting, including cosmology, meta-rules, and world overview packets.
- `02_Geography_Environment` – climates, regions, resources, and environmental cycles.
- `02_World` – global reference maps, climate systems, and natural wonders.
- `03_Peoples_Races_Species` – cultures, languages, organizations, and lineage breakdowns.
- `03_Regions` – detailed regional dossiers with assets and travel notes.
- `04_Politics_Law_Economy` – governance, legal systems, warfare, and trade.
- `04_Settlements` – settlement templates and a fully detailed example hub.
- `05_Establishments` – notable establishments, including the Brass Lantern Inn packet.
- `05_History_Timekeeping` – calendars, historical events, and dynastic records.
- `06_Factions` & `06_Magic_Science_Technology` – faction dossiers and the interplay between science, technology, and magic.
- `07_Locations_Settings` – environmental safety notes, infrastructure, and landmark indexes.
- `07_NPCs` – reusable NPC templates and a showcase character profile.
- `08_Culture_Daily_Life_Art` & `08_Quests` – cultural life, festivals, and quest frameworks.
- `09_Travel` & `09_Characters_Key_Figures` – travel routes, encounter prep, and key figures.
- `10_Encounters` & `10_Medicine_Health_Science` – encounter blueprints and medical references.
- `11_Magic_and_Technology` & `11_Additional_Resources_References` – arcane research plus research indexes.
- `12_Lore_and_History`, `13_Campaigns_and_Story_Arcs`, `14_Systems_and_Mechanics` – lore banks, campaign logs, and system hacks.
- `Dashboards`, `Indexes_and_Crosslinks`, and `Templates` – quick-access dashboards, cross-reference notes, and reusable templates.
- `4 - Details` – granular resource reference sheets imported from the legacy vault.

You can safely add more files or subfolders; the helper scripts only create missing structure. Everything is organized so Dataview, Leaflet, Breadcrumbs, and the other recommended plugins work out-of-the-box.
