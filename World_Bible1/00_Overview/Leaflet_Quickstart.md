# Obsidian Leaflet Quickstart

1. Install **Obsidian Leaflet** plugin.
2. Open any of these notes to see the map render:
   - [[02_World/World_Map_Leaflet]]
   - [[03_Regions/The_Wild_Reach/Map_Leaflet]]
   - [[09_Travel/Eastgate-The_Fogline/Route_Map_Leaflet]]
3. Replace the placeholder PNGs with your real maps **using the same filenames** so links keep working.
4. Coordinates use **pixels** within `bounds: [height, width]`. Markers use `[y, x]` order.
5. Add markers by copying the `marker:` entries. Link to notes via `popup: "[[path|Label]]"`.

**Tip:** Create additional layers with `shape:` entries (polylines, polygons, rectangles) to show borders, routes, and regions.
